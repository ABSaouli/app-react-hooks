## Hooks Dashboard

using React with hooks, redux, redux-saga, redux-react-hook, styled components


I use for this project Create React App with Typescript you will find a lot of anti typescript using like any I did it because of time of corse


to install the dependencies for the mock-backend and the react app

        
        yarn install-all
        
OR

        npm install-all
        
to run the react app 

        yarn start
        
OR

        npm start
        

to run the mock-backend 


        cd mock-backend && yarn start
        
OR

        cd mock-backend && npm start
        
you can reach both of them through 

        http://localhost:3000 => for the react app
        
        http://localhost:5000 => for the mock backend
        
to authenticate you can use 

    login : admin & password: test

for the rest of you users you can you one of this list

    maureen_brewer
    reed_howe
    henrietta_stout
    flowers_small
    joann_ayers
    ebony_hall
    holcomb_vinson
    madeline_ruiz
    duffy_fry
    alejandra_mclean
    
and the password still the same

    password = test => for all the users
        
for this project I worked with Hooks the proposal API from react I like them so I try to use them each time I can

I worked with react-cache is an unstable package for fetching the data.

I also worked with React-Redux-hooks its a proposal library to handle redux and their dispatch and mappingState.

I would love to work with useRouter to avoid withRouter and these stuff but there is no API for it if there is one, it would be nice if you can share it
 
the refresh does not work so we have an enhancement to add like persist the store and then every time we refresh we will find our data with the last change 

actualy the refresh is working because I added the redux-persist Library it took me about 10min to add it.
